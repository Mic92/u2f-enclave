# u2f-enclave

A FIDO2/CTAP2 authenticator that runs as its own **confidential VM** (AMD
SEV-SNP or Intel TDX) instead of as a USB dongle. Private keys never leave
VM-encrypted memory; the consumer talks to it over **vsock** and sees a
normal `/dev/hidraw` FIDO device via a tiny uhid bridge. Every
`makeCredential` carries a **hardware report** that binds the new
credential's public key to the launch measurement of this exact binary.

Open re-implementation of the idea behind *Hardware Authenticator Binding*
(Shiraishi & Shinagawa, COMPSAC 2025), built from scratch to keep the
trusted code small rather than forked from an existing firmware stack.

## Usage

The whole project ships as a single Linux/x86_64 binary,
`u2f-enclave`, with the guest image baked in. Running it makes a
standard FIDO2 HID device appear; anything that speaks WebAuthn or CTAP2
(browsers, `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk`, `pam_u2f`, `fido2-token`) will pick
it up like a USB key.

```console
$ # one-time: grant yourself the device nodes (or use a udev rule)
$ sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:rw /dev/kvm /dev/uhid /dev/vhost-vsock

$ u2f-enclave &
u2f-enclave: ready at /dev/hidraw3

$ fido2-token -L
/dev/hidraw3: vendor=0x1209, product=0x000a (u2f-enclave)

$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
Generating public/private ecdsa-sk key pair.
...
```

Without `--snp` the guest runs as a plain KVM VM — functionally complete
and fine for development, but the host kernel is in the trust boundary
and keys do not survive a restart.

### Hardware-bound mode (SEV-SNP)

On an EPYC host (Milan or later) with SNP enabled in BIOS and `kvm_amd`
loaded with `sev_snp=Y`:

```console
$ sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:rw /dev/sev
$ u2f-enclave --snp &
u2f-enclave: SEV-SNP launch ok (492 KiB measured)
u2f-enclave: ready at /dev/hidraw3
```

Now the host cannot read the keys, every registration carries a signed
attestation report, and keys survive restarts (see
[Key persistence](#key-persistence)).

### See the attestation

The verifier doesn't trust the SNP host — so produce a report there and
check it somewhere else.

```console
snp-host$ u2f-enclave attest > report.bin
attest: using /dev/hidraw3
attest: report_data == SHA-512(authData||cdh)
attest: cred_id      5e48c479276d74f3…
```

`attest` stands in for a browser: it registers a credential over hidraw,
checks the report is tied to it, and writes the 1184-byte report.

Fetch the chip's AMD certificate (good until that chip's next microcode
update; whichever side has network can do this):

```console
$ curl -o vcek.der "$(u2f-enclave vcek-url < report.bin)"
```

Verify — any Linux box with the same binary, no AMD hardware needed:

```console
laptop$ u2f-enclave verify --vcek vcek.der < report.bin
report_data   6f020c9e5d1731ca…
measurement   70eabebbf79908ce…  ok (matches this build)
policy        0x30000  ok
chip_id       f59a25d8302ed76a
reported_tcb  0x581b00000000000a
vcek_sig      ok
laptop$ echo $?
0
```

Exit 0 means: a genuine AMD chip signed this, and what it measured
matches what this binary would launch. `--measure` prints the SNP and
TDX measurement hex if you'd rather hard-code them; `--help` lists
everything.

## How attestation works

The `makeCredential` response is standard WebAuthn `fmt:"packed"`
self-attestation — any FIDO2 library accepts it as-is — plus one extra
field, `attStmt["snp"]`: the 1184-byte report. Libraries that don't know
about it ignore it.

A relying party that wants the hardware guarantee does three checks on
that report:

1. **Bound to this credential?** `report_data` (bytes `0x50..0x90`) must
   equal `SHA-512(authData ‖ clientDataHash)` — the same bytes the
   credential's own signature covers, so the report can't have been
   lifted from another registration.
2. **Signed by real AMD silicon?** AMD publishes a certificate (the
   *VCEK*) for every chip and firmware version. `vcek-url` builds the
   fetch URL from the report; verify the report's signature against it.
3. **Running the code you audited?** `measurement` (bytes `0x90..0xc0`)
   must match the build you reviewed. `--measure` computes that value;
   the test suite checks it against a real chip. If the computation were
   ever wrong you'd reject good reports, not accept bad ones.

All three pass → the credential's private key exists only inside an
encrypted VM running this exact binary on a genuine AMD chip.

`verify` does 2 and 3; you do 1 (you have `authData`/`clientDataHash`,
it doesn't).

### TDX

Under `--tdx` the extra field is `attStmt["tdx"]`: a 1024-byte TDREPORT.
Checks 1 and 3 work the same way (`report_data` at bytes `128..192`,
`mrtd` at `528..576`). **Check 2 does not**: a TDREPORT is not signed,
only MAC'd with a key that never leaves the chip, so nothing off that
chip can verify it. Converting it to a signed *Quote* needs Intel's SGX
quoting stack on the host, which this project doesn't depend on.

That means a hostile TDX host can forge the report. `verify` on a
TDREPORT prints a warning and exit 0 means only "the claimed measurement
matches this build". Use `--tdx` for memory encryption; for remote proof
equivalent to SNP, run `--snp` on AMD.

### Reading the report on your server

Your server gets the report as `attStmt["snp"]` (or `["tdx"]`) in the
WebAuthn `attestationObject` the browser posts; whatever WebAuthn
library you use exposes `attStmt` as a map. In Python:

```python
import cbor2, hashlib, subprocess
obj    = cbor2.loads(attestation_object)             # bytes from the browser
report = obj["attStmt"]["snp"]
r = subprocess.run(["u2f-enclave", "verify", "--vcek", "vcek.der"],
                   input=report, capture_output=True, text=True)
bound = hashlib.sha512(obj["authData"] + client_data_hash).hexdigest()
ok = r.returncode == 0 and f"report_data   {bound}" in r.stdout
```

## Key persistence

The authenticator never stores its master secret. On every launch it
asks the chip to re-derive it from a key burned into the silicon plus
the launch measurement. Same binary on the same chip ⇒ same secret ⇒
credentials keep working across restarts; change either and old
credentials stop resolving. No encrypted state files, no host-side
storage, nothing to back up.

## What's in the box

| crate    | target            | purpose                                                            |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ctap`   | `no_std` + alloc  | CTAPHID framing, CTAP2 commands, credential logic. Platform-agnostic, unit-tested on the host. |
| `enclave`| `no_std`          | The unikernel: PVH boot, paravirt GHCB (IOIO/MMIO/PSC/guest-request — no `#VC` handler), hand-rolled virtio-vsock, PSP attestation + derived-key. Cross-built and baked into `vmm`. See [DESIGN.md](enclave/DESIGN.md). |
| `vmm`    | std (Linux)       | Builds the `u2f-enclave` binary: embeds the enclave ELF, launches it under KVM (`KVM_SEV_*`, guest_memfd, secrets-page), wires its virtqueues to `/dev/vhost-vsock`, runs the uhid bridge in-process; also the `--measure`/`verify`/`attest`/`vcek-url` subcommands. |
| `bridge` | std (Linux)       | Consumer-side daemon: connects to the authenticator socket and exposes it as a HID device via `/dev/uhid`. Standalone for the cross-VM case; linked into `vmm` for the local case. |
| `sim`    | std (Linux/macOS) | Runs `ctap` over a Unix socket so the full stack can be exercised without KVM/SEV hardware. |
| `e2e`    | std               | Integration tests: drive `libfido2`, OpenSSH and `u2f-enclave verify` against the running binary. |

No QEMU, no firmware, no IGVM, no `kvm-bindings`/`kvm-ioctls`, no SVSM
protocol, no `#VC` handler/instruction decoder. RustCrypto for the crypto.

## Status

- **CTAP** – CTAPHID, `getInfo`/`makeCredential`/`getAssertion` (ES256),
  stateless non-resident credentials. Verified against `libfido2` and
  OpenSSH `sk-ecdsa`.
- **SEV-SNP** – encrypted+measured launch, paravirt GHCB, virtio over shared
  rings, guest↔PSP messaging.
- **Attestation** – report in `attStmt`, VCEK signature verified, measurement
  stable and offline-recomputable, master key persists.
- **Next** – resident keys / `clientPIN`; TDX.

## Building

```bash
nix develop          # rust toolchain with x86_64-unknown-none + libfido2
cargo build --release -p vmm     # → target/release/u2f-enclave
cargo test                        # unit + e2e (libfido2, OpenSSH, attestation)
```

Tests that need `/dev/kvm`, `/dev/uhid`, `/dev/vhost-vsock` or `/dev/sev`
print `SKIP` and pass if those are not writable. No-KVM dev loop:
`cargo run -p sim & cargo run -p bridge`.
